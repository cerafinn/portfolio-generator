## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm i` or `npm install`

<br />

## Usage

The Node application runs in the terminal. Users are required to enter either `node app` or `npm start` and the application begin running. The user will be prompted with questions. The prompts that require inputs have a validation option that prevent users from moving on without entering informaiton in the section. After entering the information, the Node application then generates an index.html in the dist folder.
